# MEMORY v3 UPDATE - 2026-10-08 (Scope 1 CLOSED)

## Scope 1: CLOSED with live proof
- Schema: students.type + enrollments.sub_start/sub_end + index students_tenant_type - migrated on LOCAL and PROD (Neon 18.6), 12 students preserved both times.
- Code: students API accept/filter type; enrollments mix warning (DEC-029) + subscription period (DEC-030); stats counters center/online (DEC-031); students page type column+field.
- Deploy: auto-deploy from GitHub confirmed by evidence (CSS tailwind markers served post-sync); commits through 299f95d live on Vercel.
- Owner live proof: type column+field visible; online student CREATED and PERSISTED on prod; both counters visible. DEC-033: owner logged into prod with LOCAL credentials after migration; real numbers shown (4/4 YES).

## Security
- CRITICAL CLOSED: demo credentials removed from login page (prefill + hint block) - commit de8e62b. Owner rotated prod admin password via UI (secret never disclosed).
- Post-migration prod login = LOCAL credentials (DEC-032 option A applied: full restore).

## Decisions added
- DEC-029: enrollment type-mix ALLOWED with warning (not blocked).
- DEC-030: subscription period fields on enrollments (sub_start/sub_end).
- DEC-031: center/online counters in stats + PageStatsCards.
- DEC-032: prod restore = full local mirror (owner approved users replacement).
- DEC-033: migration accepted - owner logged with local creds, real numbers live (4/4).
- DEC-034: prod deploy is AUTOMATIC from GitHub (evidence-based; supersedes old DEC-024 manual note).
- DEC-035: design gate = npx impeccable detect as acceptance condition for Scope U and later UI work.

## Lessons added (24-35)
24. Backup gate is a state probe: success with anomalous size reveals wrong assumption (672B dump exposed un-migrated assumption).
25. One connection string != one server identity: verify server fingerprint (startEpoch+tableCount) from each vantage (localhost resolved differently inside container vs host).
26. Critical scripts are written once, calmly, with a full self-review pass; iterative patching under fatigue breeds typos (3 in one draft).
27. Windows docker swallows double quotes in sh -c; spaced SQL breaks. Post-dump content verification (tables+COPY sections) beats pre-probes.
28. A guard may crash mid-line and the next line still prints CONFIRMED - verdict only from measured gates, never from printed claims.
29. Post-restore checks must be schema-qualified (public.students); pg_dump seeds empty search_path for its session.
30. Every execution block/starts with an explicit location guard printing the expected root (system32 incident).
31. Sensitive procedure chains ship as single guarded .ps1 files - not as separate manual steps (add-before-edit incident).
32. Verify needles derive from the same string form used to write; backtick inside single quotes is literal (v1 wrote fine, needle lied).
33. A whitelist must include the script itself and its sibling tools (self-forgotten-guard incident).
34. Skip-if-contains without full verify = skipping a potentially corrupted write. Verify ALL needles first, then decide skip/rewrite; on verify failure in skip mode -> rebuild.
35. When a small file is suspect, rebuild it COMPLETELY from known content and verify by line count + needle set (surgical line fixes caused a duplicate const).

## Production state (evidence)
- Prod DB (Neon, PG 18.6): schema S1 applied; data mirrors local (students=12, enrollments=24, groups=4, tenants=1 = Al Riyadh Training Academy).
- Prod app: S1 code + security fix live; login clean; admin password rotated by owner.
- Backups on disk (audit-out/backups, git-ignored): local-full, prod-full, prod-prerestore, local-dataonly (all verified).
- Prod users: 1 (owner, rotated password). Local remains the content canon for now.

## Scope U (NEXT - owner priority before Scope 2)
- Theme + card consistency pass BEFORE Scope 2, per owner request.
- Method: read globals.css + Shell.tsx (both PROTECTED - full read first), dashboard + students pages; produce DESIGN.md from evidence; 3 visual directions offered (refine-current / dark-premium / new-brand); owner picks.
- Acceptance gate: npx impeccable detect (install: npx impeccable install --providers=gemini; Gemini CLI: /settings -> Skills on -> /skills list). Detect must be clean (or waived explicitly) before any UI push.
- Execution: guarded .ps1 files only (established pattern).
- Impeccable anti-patterns adopted: no Inter/overused fonts, no gray-on-color text, no pure black, no cards-in-cards, no bounce easing.

## Pending from owner (carried)
- markazak original lessons 1-12 (reserved numbers, paste anytime).
- Source of the old merged memory file; origin of archived tool/ folder; author origin of commit 7629365 (likely adjacent worktree).
- Scope U visual direction choice (A/B/C) + priority (dashboard first or all screens).
